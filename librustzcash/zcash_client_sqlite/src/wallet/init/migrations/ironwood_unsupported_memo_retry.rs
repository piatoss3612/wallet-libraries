//! Requeues the received Ironwood memos of transactions whose transparent details are

//!
//! Before this migration, marking a transaction's transparent details unsupported under
//! `PrivateRequired` cleared all of its private work, including memo retrieval for its received
//! Ironwood notes, which note decryption authenticates without the transparent details. Routing
//! now keeps that work. This repairs wallets that already hold such transactions with an
//! unknown memo and nothing queued, without resetting them: notes, spend links, fees, routes,
//! and public retrieval intents are untouched, and the queued work is dispatched only privately,
//! only while public authority is absent.
